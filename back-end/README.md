# Overview

I followed the software design pattern of **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** .

I created

- User and JamSession models
- Protected Routes to forward supported request to appropriate controller action.
- User and JamSession Controllers actions to get requested data from the models.
- AuthController to validate user.
- Views(templates) would be needed to add in a future, as for now it is in a form of json.

I used `TypeORM` to connect to Database

## Other future imporvements

- Validate all the entries
- Hash Password
- Add more cool features

# Diclaimer

Just because it is a sample web I haven't stored any crediatials to .env file.
But keep in mind it is very important to do in a real life projects.
